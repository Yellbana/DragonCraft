the dragon is neutral, when tamed, it can be ridden as a boat at 4x the speed (requires a dragon's saddle and 64-90 raw fish) The dragon will "air drown" if its head is above water. It will have six seconds of being normal, and then will take two hearts per second and a half of damage. The dragon will have 120 hearts. while riding under water, player can "drown" as usual, with the usual air bubbles, wearing respiration helmet/oceanscale helmet will prolong this. The spawn rate should be .001% in ocean biomes only in the overworld, and 95% in ocean biomes in the Dragon dimension.
