to open the portal to the drago's dimension you must have a 5x5x1 ring of gold block with a (ender) dragon's egg. then you have to toss one of every scale into the ring, and the portal opens, teleporting you to the only "safe" island, a 20x20x3 floating island of bed rock.
All dragon biomes only occur once every few hundered biomes. In the dragons dimension, they occur with equal chances too eachother, and only biomes that contain dragons may spawn.
